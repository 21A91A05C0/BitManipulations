You are given a number N. Find the total count of set bits for all numbers from 1 to N(both inclusive)
Example 1:
Input: N = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
For numbers from 1 to 4.
For 1: 0 0 1 = 1 set bits
For 2: 0 1 0 = 1 set bits
For 3: 0 1 1 = 2 set bits
For 4: 1 0 0 = 1 set bits
Therefore, the total set bits is 5.
// write upon 10 binaries and and find the mearest power to a particular number and now add that nearstest power and 2** nearest number and add the remaing 1's as next set of numbers contains 
// all ones and then recursively call the numbers
int findthenearestpower(int n)
  {
      int c=0;
      while((1<<c)<=n)
      {
          c++;
      }
      return c-1;
  }
    int countSetBits(int N)
    {
        // Your logic here
        if(N==0) return 0;
        int np=findthenearestpower(N);
            
        int  ans=np*(1<<(np-1))+N-(1<<(np))+1+countSetBits(N-(1<<np));
        return ans;
    }
